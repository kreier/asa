# Ultrasonic sensor 

The ultrasonic sensor is connected to pin 2 (trigger) and 3 (echo). Some sample code is in this folder.

## Stepper motor

Stepper motor is on pin 9 and can be controlled by <include "Servo.h">. Sweeping is 30 to 150 degrees. Different setups might allow for 0 to 180 degrees, mine is limited because of the hot glue.
