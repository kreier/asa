# ASA
ASA After School Activity at AISVN with Robotics, IoT and Programming.

## Hardware

We ordered the following materials for all students to have a common ground for further experiments both in software and hardware:

1. Arduino Leonardo (because of the Micro-USB interface)
2. Robot (4 wheels - stable driving)
3. 18650 (4 AA batteries are not enough for motor and bluetooth, and not rechargable)
