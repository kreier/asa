ASA After School Activity at AISVN with Robotics, IoT and Programming.

## Hardware

We ordered the following materials at [CỬA HÀNG IC ĐÂY RỒI](https://icdayroi.com/) for all students to have a common ground for further experiments both in software and hardware:

1. [Arduino Leonardo](https://icdayroi.com/arduino-leonardo-r3) (because of the Micro-USB interface) 125.000₫
2. [Khung xe robot 4 bánh](https://icdayroi.com/khung-xe-robot-4-banh) (4 wheels - stable driving) 140.000₫
3. [Arduino Motor Shield L298](https://icdayroi.com/arduino-motor-shield-l298) 120.000₫
4. [Module thu phát bluetooth HC-05](https://icdayroi.com/module-thu-phat-bluetooth-hc-05) 80.000₫
5. [Pin Cell 18650 4200mAh 3.7V](https://icdayroi.com/pin-cell-18650-4200mah-3-7v) (4 AA batteries are not enough for motor and bluetooth, and not rechargable) 35.000₫
6. [Hộp đế pin 18650 loại 2 cell](https://icdayroi.com/hop-de-pin-18650-loai-2-cell) battery holder for two 18650 batteries ₫
7. [Công tắc gạt MTS-103 3 trạng thái](https://icdayroi.com/cong-tac-gat-mts-103-3-trang-thai) power switch for the robot 5.500₫
8. [Đồng hồ đo Vôn (Volt) 3.5-30V](https://icdayroi.com/dong-ho-do-von-volt-3-5-30v) Voltage display to check the charge level of the battery 22.000₫
5. Four 10 cm cable 0.25 mm² to connect the motors to the shield ₫
6. Three female-male jumper wire to connect the bluetooth module to the Arduino (+3.3V, GND, RX)
7. So in general: some [jumper wires](https://icdayroi.com/bo-day-cam-test-board-65-soi) 19.000₫
8. Maybe [a breadboard](https://icdayroi.com/testboard-mini-syb-170) to connect 5.000₫

## Building steps

* Assemble the robot
* Connect the motors to M1 and M4 on the L293D shield
